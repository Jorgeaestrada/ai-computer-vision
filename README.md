## Features

Here're some of the project's features:

*   You can do simple facial recognition
*   Lightweight to run on any PC
*   Easy to use

## Installation Steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Download and install the project requirements whith Python pip through the next command: "pip install -r requirements.txt"
3. Put in the directory "face-recognition/images/. . ." the images for training our model recognizer in the next format: 
  - face-recognition/images/person-1
  - face-recognition/images/person-2
  - . . .
  - face-recognition/images/person-n
4. Run the faces-train.py script through the next command: "python3 faces-train.py" to train the LBPH recognition algorithm
5. Run the  face-recogition.py script through the next command: "python3 face-recognition.py" to test the facial recognition
6. Enjoy!
